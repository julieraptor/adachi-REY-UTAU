**ADACHI_REY (足立霊 / Adachi Ryou)** is a fanloid inspired by Adachi Rei, and is a fusion of [LIEE : Immortal Idol](https://github.com/julieraptor/DIFFSINGER-LIEE-Immortal-Idol) and Adachi Rei's designs and concepts.

**Adachi_REY** is very optimistic, friendly, and curious. She is very faithful and an overachiever. She is very patient, however, this also means she will wait for others to say or do something instead of doing it herself.
